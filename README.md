Ukagaka
=======

.NET version Ukagaka

This project is created since I need to create a reminder to issue progress in Redmine(A project management web site, my company use it for project management).
But I'd like to add more features.

Although this project is named after Ukagaka, it uses no source code from original Ukagaka/SSP(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukagaka)... Well, also because of my poor Japanese.

1. Kikka (Shell):
