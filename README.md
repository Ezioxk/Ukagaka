Ukagaka
=======

.NET version Ukagaka
This project is created since I need to create a reminder to issue progress in Redmine.
But I'd like to add more features.

Although this project is named after Ukagaka, it uses no source code from original Ukagaka.

On third-party resources,
I cannot find under what license image resources of Kikka are. If it violate any privacy, please kindly let me know.

Redmine API is under Apache 2 open-source license

.NET Framework 4.0 and Windows Installer 3.5 is required for running.
